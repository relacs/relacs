\class EventList
\brief A container for EventData
\author Jan Benda
\version 1.1

Use push() or add() to add EventData to the list.

The range operator[] returns a reference to an EventData
specified either by index or identifier.

The index() function returns the index of an EventData specified
by its identifier.

\todo check equal size of input SampleDataD in e.g. rate, etc.
