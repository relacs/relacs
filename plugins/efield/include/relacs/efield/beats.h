\par Chirps 

Chirps are generated whenever at least one frequency of chirps
(chirpfrequency) or a file containing the timepoints of chirps is
specified. If only a chirp frequency is specified, then series of
evenly spaced chirps with that frequency are produced. If only a file
containing times is specified (no chirpfrequency) then the chirps are
positioned as specified in the file. If in addition a chirp frequency
is specified, the timepoints in the file are scaled with the inverse
frequency. By specifying as many chirp frequencies as there are delta f's
the chirp frequency can be made dependent on delta f.

The chirptimesfile may contain several blocks of chirp time sequences.
These are then used one after the other as specified by chirptimeshuffle.

\par LED Output

In case an "LED-1" output channel is defined, a 5 V signal is put out
during stimulation. During generated chirps this signal is set to -5 V.
