Qt4:
- check the use of mutexes in wait() (e.g. in Control, RePro, RELACSWidget, ReadLoop(?))
- further improve Macros
  (get rid of the friends, split startNextRepRro onto Macro and
  MacroCommand, etc)
- what is the difference between RePro::name() and ReProData::Name???
- how to use enurePolished() in SaveFiles and Session
- Settings dialog: default paht for dry/ - mkdir dry/!
- What about the autoAdd functionality of Layouts?
- base:setOutput: what is wrong with the setTabOrder() call? Do we really need it?


SignalTime: finish this update (RELACSPlugin::signalTime()
- test ficurve RePro: does not work!
- update all other RePros
- remove from InData and EventData?
- update Acquire::readSignal()

Analog Input/Output:
- WriteDataThread should not be started if the whole stimulus is already transfered.
- check and improve writeReset and writeZero interfaces and implementations.
- directWrite implementation should take care about synchronization as well!
  ComediAnalogOutput should use instruction lists for this.

Dynamic clamp:
- write back real time loop frequency to InList and OutList samplerate.
- rewrite analog input part of the dynamic clamp loop in dynclampmodul
  similar to the analog output part
- shouldn't it be better if the model would get the parameter first,
  then computes, and then analog output takes place?

Save files:
- check on hardware and with short stimuli!
- check saveToggle, i.e. event times and stimuli indices!

Thread safety:
- make sure that any QWidget does not raise, lower, close, update, repaint, erase, 
  (i.e. calls a function that triggers an Qt event) outside the GUI thread!
  - show & hide: in Macros::loadMacros(), in RePros::raise(), in OptWidget::assign(),
    OptDialog::exec(), in auditory::Session
- make sure that all RePro, Macro, and Session starting and stopping is
  done from the GUI thread only!
- disentangle start and stopSession calls?
- OptWidget::assign is not thread safe
- shouldn't the draw() function in Plot and MultiPlot not just be QWidget::update()?
  update() calls postEvent() !
- (Multi)Plot::draw() can be called from within the locks!

Metadata:
- Devices should get and use Options for their settings
- OutData should get and use Options for stimulus metadata
- stimulus section needs a name, a file (if available) and properties
- A new metadatawriter class instead of saveXML functions
- Parameter::label should get a level that is used to make sections in the XML file ?

Acquisition interface:
- check whether test, prepare, and start can be used simulataneously with read/write
- add single data read and write
- add function for blocked write() and corresponding error checking (buffer underrun)
- need a ComediNIRTSI device class.
- manual convert of signals does not work, because some gain settings are needed in advance!

Plugins:
- Put relacs configuration files in root directory of the plugin sets

Relacs:
- How are plugins (control, repros) found/identified? Possibility of name clashes!
  Use plugin-set name as well.
- Parameter/Options/OptWidget: generalize selectText() and index() to all types
- Fix command line arg names from path to dir in relacsmain and RELACSWidget.
- The right name for dlopen can be found in the dlname field of the *.la file!
  Use this approach for loading the plugins?
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  -> On/off by user?
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log?
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)

Documentation:
- Update doxygen dot settings
- Update Makefile instructions to autotools
- You may want to use: ./configure --htmldir=DOCDIR/html
- Static libraries are disabled by default, enable with --enable-static
- Mention that all m4/ , *.mk , and Doxyfile files are identical and should remain so
- Hint to 
  Integrating Qt's Meta object compiler (moc) with GNU Automake
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=133
  and
  The Autotools file jungle (== version 3)
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=131
- when changing the interface of the libraries 
  make sure that nothing is installed in prefix/lib!
  For finalizing a change in the interface the version number of the library
  needs to be changed.
- For developing: make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain pathes to any relacs libraries,
  best is to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""
- Links:
  CRCNS - Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience - Data sharing activity
  http://www.crcns.org/
- Add brief documentation to the examples! (a README file)
- update documentation of OutData, TraceSpec
- RTAI include path: --with-rtai=/usr/src/rtai-3.6/base/include

Libraries:
- Add relacs library tests to the libraries!
- AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( gnits )
- autoreconf:
  * configure.ac.in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
  * Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4

Autotools:
- Make datatools a separate project
- Check m4 macro style
- Check for C++ requirements (STL, templates)
- Math library check: LT_LIB_M
- moc3.mk: clean-am should be clean-local, but this is not called from Makefile!
  However, why is this clean-am not overriding the original clean-am?
- We need GNU make for the moc rules. And therefore test for GNU make.
  However, can't we use from automake "18.2 Handling new file extensions"
  something like:
  SUFFIXES = .h .moc.cc
  .h.moc.cc :
	$(MOC) -i -o "$@" "$<"
  However, the header files are not in the same directory!
- Add rand55 test and make sure that the dox file PREDEFINED variable gets HAVE_LIBRAND55 define set
  http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz
- upgrade to Automake 1.10.1 and add LZMA support, remove .zip archives
- uninstall: also remove relacs subdirectories?!
- Use current version of doxygen for debian,
  update the Doxyfile or remove new/old settings
- make distcheck: 
  release.sh /home/jan/prj/relacs/relacsinstall --with-qt3=/usr/lib/qt3 --disable-doxygen-dot

---------------------------------

RePros:
  - use convert( OutData& )!
  - check save() function of all RePros.
  - test all RePros! Especially the files they are saving.

Adjust input range:
  - outsource this in a control widget or to the PlotTrace widget.
  - Search/FIField: slower change of input range!
    * option: increase range only
    * decrease range after n stimuli only

SpikeDetector: 
  - Add plot showing the time evolution of the spike size.
  - Save this trace!

Macros:
  - Possibility to quit a macro after  the current RePro finished normally
    (similar to break, but without softStopRequest).

Devices:
  - mechanism for passing name=value pairs to open()
  - Add and implement probe() and possibly requires() function
  - implement settings() (AnalogIn/Output, Attenuator, Attenuate already done)
  - implement "dummy (DocDevice)" devices that only get infos from
    the config file and thus serve as documentation of all the used hardware.

Attenuate:
  - interaction with gain settings of daq board? Are there boards with
    many gains for analog output?

ConfigDialog:
  - check recursive mutex

Model:
  - check recursive mutexes

Filter/Detectors/PlotTrace:
  Make PlotTrace better configurable!

Plugins:
 - use Qt shared libraries interface!? 
   QWidgetPlugin would replace addPlugin and/or the Plugin class (?)
   and can contain whatever classes as plugins.
   What about Qt 4? Provides a new and much better interface!

OutData, Acquire:
 - handle unset SampleInterval

A virtual I/O Data handler controlling the data flow in RELACS.
 - online data aquisition
 - simulation
 - data browser
 - data analysis

RELACS:
 - "labbook/protocol/log" options as a tab along with the session
   for recording manual manipulations of the experiment.
   Saved directly in the trigger.dat file and
   available to the RePros. 
 - clear and reset all inputdata, eventdata and data acquisition 
   at session start and session end to avoid index and time overflows!
 - IOData, EventData, FileWrite, ...: new time zero reference handling!

A new Tab-Widget Container:
 - show tabs only if more than one tab
 - switch between tabs with shift-arrow left/right
 - minimizable
 - button menu on right click
 - check KDE for such a widget (KJanusWidget)
 - use for detectors and sessions and repros


---------------------------------

Finding a P-Unit:
 - Phase-locked spike response?
   If not it might be a Pd feedback fiber (at 80-100Hz).
 - SAM: P-Unit fires only on rising face, 
   5Hz beat, 20% Contrast, 10 beat cycles.
