Thread safety:
- make sure that any QWidget does not move, resize, show or hide
  (i.e. calls a function that triggers an Qt event) outside the GUI thread!
- make sure that all RePro, Macro, and Session starting and stopping is
  done from the GUI thread only!
- disentangle start and stopSession calls?
- what is qApp->syncX and flushX all about?


Acquisition interface:
- improve the readSignal function in RELACSWidget::write()
- check whether test, prepare, and start can be used simulataneously with read/write
- add single data read and write
- add function for blocked write() and corresponding error checking (buffer underrun)
- need a DIO device interface
- need a ComediNIPFI and a ComediNIRTSI device class.
- check output through attenuator (the AnalogOutput part)

Plugins:
- Put relacs configuration files in root directory of the plugin sets

Relacs:
- How are plugins (control, repros) found/identified? Possibility of name clashes!
  Use plugin-set name as well.
- Fix command line arg names from path to dir in relacsmain and RELACSWidget.
- The right name for dlopen can be found in the dlname field of the *.la file!
  Use this approach for loading the plugins?
- Reading config from PWD and LD_LIBRARY_PATH containing PWD
  -> On/off by user?
- Log files written to relacs exec dir, not /var/log?
  - Set log location in <relacslocal>/<src/relacs>
    use @...@ for this (prefix?)

Documentation:
- Update doxygen dot settings
- Update installation and Makefile instructions to autotools
- Usage of autoreconf: autoreconf -v -i
- You may want to use: ./configure --htmldir=DOCDIR/html
- Static libraries are disabled by default, enable with --enable-static
- Mention that all m4/ , *.mk , and Doxyfile files are identical and should remain so
- Hint to 
  Integrating Qt's Meta object compiler (moc) with GNU Automake
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=133
  and
  The Autotools file jungle (== version 3)
    http://blog.hartwork.org/?p=131
- when changing the interface of the libraries 
  make sure that nothing is installed in prefix/lib!
  For finalizing a change in the interface the version number of the library
  needs to be changed.
- For developing: make sure LD_LIBRARY_PATH does not contain pathes to any relacs libraries,
  best is to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH=""
- Links:
  CRCNS - Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience - Data sharing activity
  http://www.crcns.org/
- Add brief documentation to the examples! (a README file)
- update documentation of OutData, TraceSpec
- RTAI include path: --with-rtai=/usr/src/rtai-3.6/base/include

Libraries:
- Add relacs library tests to the libraries!
- AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE( gnits )
- autoreconf:
  * configure.ac.in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIR([m4])
  * Makefile.am: ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS = -I m4

Autotools:
- Make datatools a separate project
- Check m4 macro style
- Check for C++ requirements (STL, templates)
- Math library check: LT_LIB_M
- moc3.mk: clean-am should be clean-local, but this is not called from Makefile!
  However, why is this clean-am not overriding the original clean-am?
- We need GNU make for the moc rules. And therefore test for GNU make.
  However, can't we use from automake "18.2 Handling new file extensions"
  something like:
  SUFFIXES = .h .moc.cc
  .h.moc.cc :
	$(MOC) -i -o "$@" "$<"
  However, the header files are not in the same directory!
- Add rand55 test and make sure that the dox file PREDEFINED variable gets HAVE_LIBRAND55 define set
  http://summa.physik.hu-berlin.de/~beule/random/random55.tar.gz
- upgrade to Automake 1.10.1 and add LZMA support, remove .zip archives
- uninstall: also remove relacs subdirectories?!
- Use current version of doxygen for debian,
  update the Doxyfile or remove new/old settings
- make distcheck: 
  release.sh /home/jan/prj/relacs/relacsinstall --with-qt3=/usr/lib/qt3 --disable-doxygen-dot

Bug in xarray.cc: Problems with the pow function (in containerfuncs.h)


new RePro name: ExPro, Protocol, ...

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Update 1.8.18 oel.cfg:
  - "extref" for AnalogOutput devices
  - new config section FilterDetectors in oel.cfg!
  - remove eventdetector.h eventdetector.cc, detectors.h detectors.cc,
    *dock*, make dependall
  - add to outputdata:
       outputtraceid: Left-Speaker|Right-Speaker
  outputtracechannel: 0|1
   outputtracedevice: ao-1|ao-1
  outputtracemaxrate: 240|240kHz
    outputtracedelay: 0|0ms
  - add devices:

*Analog Input Devices
  plugin1: DAQNIE|AISim
  device1: /dev/comedi0
   ident1: ai-1

*Analog Output Devices
  plugin1: DAQNIE|AOSim
  device1: /dev/comedi1
   ident1: ao-1

- in Attenuator Interfaces change "daq1: daq-1" to "ao1: ao-1"

Update 1.8.14:
  - make cleanall
  - daq/src: remove eventdata.* eventlist.* detector.h
  - numerics/src: remove basefuncs.h
  - oel.cfg: replace "daq1: 0" by "daq1: daq-1" in AttInterfaces
             remove "mode1" line in AttDevices
  - oelplugins.cfg: Auditory Neuron Model

---------------------------------

RePros:
  - use convert( OutData& )!
  - check save() function of all RePros.
  - test all RePros! Especially the files they are saving.

Adjust input range:
  - outsource this in a control widget or to the PlotTrace widget.
  - Search/FIField: slower change of input range!
    * option: increase range only
    * decrease range after n stimuli only

SpikeDetector: 
  - Add plot showing the time evolution of the spike size.
  - Save this trace!

Macros:
  - Possibility to quit a macro after  the current RePro finished normally
    (similar to break, but without softStopRequest).

Devices:
  - mechanism for passing name=value pairs to open()
  - Add and implement probe() and possibly requires() function
  - implement settings() (AnalogIn/Output, Attenuator, Attenuate already done)
  - implement "dummy (DocDevice)" devices that only get infos from
    the config file and thus serve as documentation of all the used hardware.

Attenuate:
  - interaction with gain settings of daq board? Are there boards with
    many gains for analog output?

ConfigDialog:
  - check recursive mutex

Model:
  - check recursive mutexes

Filter/Detectors/PlotTrace:
  Make PlotTrace better configurable!

Plugins:
 - use Qt shared libraries interface!? 
   QWidgetPlugin would replace addPlugin and/or the Plugin class (?)
   and can contain whatever classes as plugins.
   What about Qt 4? Provides a new and much better interface!

OutData, Acquire:
 - handle unset SampleInterval

A virtual I/O Data handler controlling the data flow in RELACS.
 - online data aquisition
 - simulation
 - data browser
 - data analysis

RELACS:
 - "labbook/protocol/log" options as a tab along with the session
   for recording manual manipulations of the experiment.
   Saved directly in the trigger.dat file and
   available to the RePros. 
 - clear and reset all inputdata, eventdata and data acquisition 
   at session start and session end to avoid index and time overflows!
 - IOData, EventData, FileWrite, ...: new time zero reference handling!

A new Tab-Widget Container:
 - show tabs only if more than one tab
 - switch between tabs with shift-arrow left/right
 - minimizable
 - button menu on right click
 - check KDE for such a widget (KJanusWidget)
 - use for detectors and sessions and repros


---------------------------------

Finding a P-Unit:
 - Phase-locked spike response?
   If not it might be a Pd feedback fiber (at 80-100Hz).
 - SAM: P-Unit fires only on rising face, 
   5Hz beat, 20% Contrast, 10 beat cycles.
