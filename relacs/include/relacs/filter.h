        A Filter is a widget, i.e. you can display parameters 
        or plot something on the screen. 
	\a mode is passed to the resulting InData or EventData.
	\a type determines the type of the filter or detector.
        \a outtraces is the number of produced output traces.
        If \a outtraces == 0, then the number of output traces
        equals the number of input traces.
        The %Filter is named \a name (has to be identical
        to the class name) and belongs to the set of plugins
	named \a pluginset.
	The implementation of a class derived from Filter
	has the version \a version and was written
	by \a author on \a date. */
