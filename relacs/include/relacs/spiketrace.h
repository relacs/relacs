  \version 1.0
  \brief A nice, almost useless widget, showing an animated trace of a spike.
  
  
  The SpikeTrace-widget shows a darkgreen voltage trace with a single spike.
  A green ball is running from left to right along the trace.
  At each repetition the position of the spike is changed randomly.
  This is like the trace on an oscilloscope.
  
  Use setSpike() to toggle this animation completly on and off.
  With setPause() the animation can be stopped and restarted.
  
  Reimplementate trace() to get a better trace.
