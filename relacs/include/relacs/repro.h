	Within this thread the RePro, all input data, events, meta data,
	and stimulus data are already locked (via lockAll()).
	Access to those data is unlocked during sleep(), sleepOn(), and sleepWait().
	Beware that main() is executed in a thread different from the GUI thread.
	Use postCustomEvent() to call some functions that eventually
	paint something on the screen.
	The function should return one of the \a DoneStates except Continue.
	After main() terminated
        a message is written ( "Repro succesfully completed",
	"RePro stopped" or "RePro interupted", depending on the return value)
        and RELACS is informed. 
	You need to return from main() if the sleep(), sleepOn(),
	or interrupt() functions return \c true.
	Also, if you lock() and unlock() the RePro manually,
	you should check interrupt() directly after each unlock().
	If interrupt() returns \c true, you should be careful with
	posting custom events via postCustomEvent, since they might be executed
	after the RePro terminated. This includes calling message() and
